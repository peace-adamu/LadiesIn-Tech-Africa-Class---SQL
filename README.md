#### Discussion of Results: International Breweries Dataset
###### Dataset Overview
The International Breweries dataset was provided by the Ladies in Tech Africa initiative and contains detailed records of sales transactions across various countries, brands, and years. The dataset includes essential information on sales representatives, brands, plant costs, unit prices, quantities sold, and the resulting profit. Key columns include:

- SALES_ID: Unique identifier for each sales transaction.
- SALES_REP: The sales representative responsible for the sale.
- EMAILS: Contact information for the sales representatives.
- BRANDS: The name of the brand sold.
- PLANT_COST: The cost associated with the production plant for each brand.
- UNIT_PRICE: The price per unit of the product sold.
- QUANTITY: The number of units sold in each transaction.
- COST: The total cost of the sale.
- PROFIT: The profit generated from each sale.
- COUNTRY: The country in which the sale took place.
- REGION: The geographical region (e.g., West Africa, East Africa).
- MONTHS: The month of the sale.
- YEARS: The year in which the sale occurred.
#### Key Insights:
1. Total Profit Calculation The overall profitability of the International Breweries' operations was calculated using the query:
   
```
SELECT SUM(profit) AS TotalProfit 
FROM [dbo].[International_Breweries]
```
![sqlb1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc1a0278-9842-4c92-a579-12365bf6e3dc)
- Result
The total profit generated by International Breweries, across all operations, amounts to 105,587,420.

- Significance of Total Profit
This total profit figure is crucial for understanding the overall financial health and performance of the company. The result reflects the cumulative success of the company's sales operations over multiple years and across different markets.

2. Country-Specific Profit Analysis Focusing on specific countries like Senegal and Nigeria allowed for an in-depth look at regional profitability. For instance, the query:

```
SELECT SUM(profit) AS Totalprofit_nig
FROM [dbo].[International_Breweries]
WHERE countries = 'Nigeria' AND Years = '2019'
```
 ![sqlb2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/208d6574-edd1-4aaf-977c-aa05b9c2da01)
- Result: The total profit for Nigeria in the year 2019 is 4,805,320
- Significance:
This result reflects Nigeria's financial contribution to International Breweries in 2019, offering insights into the company's performance in this key market. It helps evaluate:
i. Market-Specific Profitability: Nigeria's impact on overall profitability.
ii. Yearly Trends: A basis for comparison with previous and future years.
iii. Strategic Focus: Whether resources should be increased in Nigeria based on profit margins.

3. Categorizing Countries by Language Group A final analysis was done to categorize countries into Anglophone (English-speaking) and Francophone (French-speaking) groups, based on sales performance from 2017 to 2019:
   
```
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN COUNTRIES IN ('NIGERIA', 'GHANA') THEN 'Anglophone'
        ELSE 'Francophone'
    END AS CountriesGroup,
    SUM(profit) AS Totalprofit 
FROM [dbo].[International_Breweries]
WHERE Years IN ('2017', '2018', '2019')
GROUP BY Countries
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
![sqlb3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73e3d6aa-5194-4dd0-90eb-67453fb62e24)
- Result: The countries were categorized based on their primary language using a CASE WHEN statement to group them into Anglophone (English-speaking) and Francophone (French-speaking) regions
- Significance: 
This result shows nearly balanced profitability between Anglophone and Francophone countries over the years 2017-2019, highlighting the success of International Breweries in both language groups. These insights allow for targeted marketing and operational strategies based on language group performance, facilitating tailored regional approaches

## Conclusion
The SQL project encompassed various foundational and advanced database management skills. It involved designing a comprehensive database, creating tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing complex queries for data analysis. We successfully implemented:

- Database Design and Table Creation: Structured employee, person, and salary tables to manage organizational data.
- Data Manipulation: Used CRUD operations to effectively insert, update, and delete data, ensuring flexibility in managing information.
- Complex Queries and Analysis: Leveraged SQL functions like SUM(), AVG(), MAX(), and GROUP BY for in-depth analysis, providing insights into employee data, salary distribution, and conditional logic using CASE WHEN.
- Joining Tables: Combined data from multiple tables to create meaningful reports and aggregate information, reflecting a holistic view of the data.
- Conditional Logic and Grouping: Used CASE WHEN for categorizing employee data based on age and profit categorization by regions in International Breweries.
- Real-World Data Analysis: Imported and analyzed large datasets (e.g., International Breweries), extracting key business insights like total profit, country-wise profit, and yearly trends.
